The rumours of an Apple tablet just don't seem to go away, but what are
we supposed to do until it arrives? And would you even want one if it
did? Whilst there have been hints that Apple is preparing the next
version of Mac OS X for a [touch interface] [1], a more obvious choice
would seem to be a version running the iPhone OS. And the problem with a
tablet running the iPhone OS is all the restrictions that come along
with it too - no browser choice, the application approval process and
lack of expandability.

For my purposes, I'd like a small machine for casual coffee shop
reading, web browsing and maybe a spot of development with a [wireless
keyboard][2] attached. Windows 7, especially with it's [touch pack] [3],
and Firefox would be ideal for this purpose.

Previous attempts at UMPC and Tablet PCs [haven't caught on] [4], so short
of [building your own] [5], what's coming soon or out there already?

### Axiotron Modbook

When talking Apple tablet PC or media pad, then [Axiotron
Modbook] [6] immediately springs to mind. Basically
take a MacBook, cut it in half and place a touch screen placed on top.
Whilst this produces a decent outcome, for my needs this is too
expensive and too heavy.

**Pros:** Decent hardware, can run Mac OS X and Windows

**Cons:** Expensive, Heavy

### Sahara Slate

    </a>
</div>
  
The [Sahara Slate] [7] is a full featured Tablet PC,
based upon a low voltage Core 2 Duo processor running at 1.5 GHz. The
choice of CPU could leave it slightly on the anaemic side. With a sleek
design that owes a lot in common with the Modbook, the Sahara Slate PC
proves it's a ground up slate design by it's relative slimness and light
weight. The main issue is that, like the Modbook, it comes with a laptop
specification price tag.

**Pros:** Nice design, Ground up slate design

**Cons:** Expensive, Could be lighter (1.6kg)

### Motion Computing LE1700

        <img src="/content/images/blog/tablet-pc-motion.jpg" alt="Motion Computing LE1700" />
    </a>
</div>

The [Motion Computing LE1700] [8] features
pretty much the same specifications as the Sahara, however is a shade
lighter at 1.5kg. Motion also produced a rugadized tablet, the [Motion
J3400] [9] with a beefier 1.6ghz CPU but is however a tad heavier.

**Pros:** Ground up Slate design, Faster CPU on J3400

**Cons:** Expensive, could be lighter (1.5 kg)

### AMtek T10L

    </a>
</div>

A netbook tablet would seem to hit the sweet spot, an inexpensive
machine featuring the now standard netbook components (1.6 Ghz Atom, 2GB
ram, 80GB disk). This is what [AMtek appear to offer] [10],
however no word yet on availability or pricing.

**Pros:** Light (1.18kg), Cheap (hopefully)

**Cons:** Relatively unknown manufacturer

### Archos 9

<div class="center spaced no-border">
    <a href="http://www.archos.com/products/nb/archos_9/index.html?country=cn?=en" title="Archos 9" style="width: 400px;">
        <img src="/content/images/blog/tablet-pc-archos-9.jpg" alt="Archos 9" />
    </a>
</div>

Archos recently released details of a [netbook tablet] [11] shipping with
Windows 7. Featuring a new Atom Z515 processor clocked at 1.2Ghz, I'm
not sure how the processor would hold up. Also, in the [demonstration
video] [12], it looks like the tablet doesn't have Aero glass enabled. As
the Archos 9 runs Windows 7, it's release date isn't going to be until
at least [October 22nd] [13].

**Pros:** Weight (less than 800g), Price (hopefully)

**Cons:** Processor speed?, Windows 7 Aero?

### Honourable Mention: CrunchPad

<div class="center spaced no-border">
    <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/03/crunchpad-the-launch-prototype/" title="CrunchPad" style="width: 400px;">
        <img src="/content/images/blog/tablet-pc-crunchpad.jpg" alt="CrunchPad" />
    </a>
</div>

Not many details on the [CrunchPad] [14] yet apart from a few
videos floating about on [YouTube] [15]. Whilst the machine itself looks
great, I would be concerned that an inflexibile the operating system
would put this firmly in the realm of consumer electronic device rather
than full PC.

**Pros:** Atom based (hopefully cheap), Thin (18mm), light tablet design

**Cons:** Flexibility in custom Linux operating system

### Conclusion

It seems that in the next few months we'll see a lot developments in the
slate PC form factor - perhaps the Tablet PC is finally coming of age?
Whilst these upcoming machines look promising, there is always the
possibility that Apple could come out with a device that would blow them
all out of the water...
