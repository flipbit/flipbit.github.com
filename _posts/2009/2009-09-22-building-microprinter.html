Whilst reading about <a href="http://bookcamp.pbworks.com/PaperCamp" title="PaperCamp Wiki">Papercamp</a> I came across the concept of <a href="http://microprinter.pbworks.com/" title="Microprinting Wiki">Microprinting</a>.  The idea is simple, take an old receipt printer and repurpose it to stream a live feed of your updates from the Internet.  The idea was first mentioned by Matt Webb in his post about <a href="http://berglondon.com/blog/2006/10/06/my-printer-my-social-letterbox/">social letter boxes</a>, and put into practice by <a href="http://tomtaylor.co.uk/projects/microprinter/" title="Microprinting Project">Tom Taylor</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Inspired by this, I decided to make my own micro-printer.  I've created a <a href="http://www.flipbit.co.uk/micro-printer.html" title="Microprinting Project on flipbit.co.uk">project page</a> that lists the steps, materials, and general details required to make your own microprinter.

At 7:30 each morning I get a daily reports with information such as the tube status, weather and Google Analytics for various sites I maintain.  Unlike an iPhone, I can just grab these reports off the printer and not worry about the battery running out or loosing reception on the tube.  At the end of the day I shred the reports and put them out for recycling.

Examples of the weather and tube report.  I cycle to work most days, so the tube report is only printed if it's raining.
