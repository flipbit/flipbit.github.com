<p>
The <a href="https://hudson.dev.java.net/" title="hudson: an extensible continuous integration engine">Hudson Continuous Integration</a> server has been my continuous integration platform of choice for about a year now, mainly because of it’s ease of use and configurability.
</p>
<p>
Whilst working on a project for a client last year, I needed to monitor the status of the build whenever someone checked in.  There are <a title="Hudson Tray Notification" href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Hudson+Tray+Application">numerous ways</a> of achieving this already, however we wanted a separate PC running next to the team with a full-screen display letting everyone know the build status.
</p>
<h3>
Accessing Hudson with .NET
</h3>
<p>
To achieve this task I wrote a .NET wrapper for the <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Remote+access+API" title="Hudson Remote Access API">Hudson Remote API</a>.   This RESTful API enables a program to query the status and history of the builds running on the Hudson server.  An ASP.NET MVC application then takes this information and displays it on a webpage that can be run full-screen in a browser.

</p>
<p>
It is much easier to quickly see the status of the build on the 40 inch display rather than through the default web interface or a tray icon!
</p>
<p>
The monitor displays information such as build number, subversion revision and the check-in comments.  If an image with the same name as the user checking in the code exists on the server, their avatar is displayed.  This <a title="Build Avatars in Agile Teams" href="http://blog.cogworks.co.uk/2009/06/build-avatars-in-agile-teams.html">obfuscates who did the build to the outside world</a>.  
</p>
<p>
We found that displaying the avatar of the last user also was a strong encouragement for developers to check that the build wasn’t broken before checking in their own code.

<h3>
Downloading the Monitors and Source Code
</h3>
<p>
I’ve recently revisited the code and re-written it from scratch, adding more robust unit tests and support for a WPF monitor running in the system tray or Windows 7 Superbar.  All the code is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/hudson-lib/" title="Hudson .NET Library">open sourced on Google code</a>.
</p>

Screen shots and downloads are <a title="Hudson Monitors and .NET Library" href="http://www.cogworks.co.uk/hudson/hudson-monitor.html">available here</a>.
