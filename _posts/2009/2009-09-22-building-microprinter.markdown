Whilst reading about [Papercamp] [1] I came across the concept of [Microprinting] [2].  The idea is simple, 
take an old receipt printer and repurpose it to stream a live feed of your updates from the Internet.  The 
idea was first mentioned by Matt Webb in his post about [social letter boxes] [3], and put into practice by
[Tom Taylor] [4].

Inspired by this, I decided to make my own micro-printer.  I've created a [project page] [5] that lists the 
steps, materials, and general details required to make your own microprinter.

At 7:30 each morning I get a daily reports with information such as the tube status, weather and Google 
Analytics for various sites I maintain.  Unlike an iPhone, I can just grab these reports off the printer 
and not worry about the battery running out or loosing reception on the tube.  At the end of the day I 
shred the reports and put them out for recycling.

Examples of the weather and tube report.  I cycle to work most days, so the tube report is only printed if it's raining.
