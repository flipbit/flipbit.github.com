<p>I've updated the <a href="http://www.cogworks.co.uk/annotation/index.html" title="Image Annotation Plugin">jQuery Image Annotation Plugin</a> and moved it over to the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jquery-image-annotate/" title="Image Annotation Plugin Repository on Google Code">Google Code site</a>.  Hopefully this will simplify the updating process.<br />
</p><p>The plugin now has a bug fixed that caused an error when loading an image with no previous annotations, and also has been tested with jQuery 1.3.2 (although there are a few CSS quirks that need to be ironed out).<br />
</p><p>I have a plan to develop the plugin further, adding support for toggling annotations on and off, plus enabling multiple annotated images on the same page.<br />
