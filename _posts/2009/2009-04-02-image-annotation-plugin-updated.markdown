Iâ€™ve updated the [jQuery Image Annotation Plugin][] and moved it over to
the [Google Code site][]. Hopefully this will simplify the updating
process.  

The plugin now has a bug fixed that caused an error when loading an
image with no previous annotations, and also has been tested with jQuery
1.3.2 (although there are a few CSS quirks that need to be ironed
out).  

I have a plan to develop the plugin further, adding support for toggling
annotations on and off, plus enabling multiple annotated images on the
same page.
