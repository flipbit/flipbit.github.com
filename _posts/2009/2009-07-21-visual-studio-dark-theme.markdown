I have never been much of a fan of changing the [color schemes in Visual
studio] [1], however whilst working on a Ruby on Rails site for a month or
so, I came to enjoy using the [e editor's] [2] cappuccino scheme.

Loosely based upon Textmate's [Vibrant Ink] [3] scheme, I found it hard to
adjust to the dark background at first, however after a few days I'd
find it hard to go back.

Using [Oren Ellenbogen's dark theme] [4] as a base, I ported the
cappuccino theme to Visual Studio 2008:

<div class="center spaced">
        <img src="/content/images/blog/visual-studio-dark-theme.jpg" alt="Visual Studio Dark Theme" />
</div>

I'd recommend trying a dark theme for a few days if you haven't before.
It's easier on your eyes if your programming in the evening, especially
if you set up a [light behind your monitor] [5].

You can [download the colour scheme here] [6].
