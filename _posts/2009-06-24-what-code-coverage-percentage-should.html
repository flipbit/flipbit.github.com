How many unit tests should you write for your code?  100%?  50%?  It could depend where abouts you are in the <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/karlseguin/archive/2009/04/27/the-7-phases-of-unit-testing.aspx">7 phases of unit testing</a>.

I dislike 100% coverage as I think it says more about the time you have at hand to write tests, even though some <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/patricksmacchia/archive/2009/06/13/i-love-100-coverage.aspx">support the idea</a>.  As a rule of thumb, I prefer is to say that half the code you write should be test code, and that this will naturally be skewed towards the more complex areas of your system.

But then how do you test all those getters and setters?  I usually find these fall out in testing Domain and Model object mappings, or in data access testing.  The message is to get the coverage up by doing functional testing, rather than purely coverage improving testing.
